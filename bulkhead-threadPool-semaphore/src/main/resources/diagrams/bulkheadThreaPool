Client -> Controller 
activate Controller #FFBBBB
Controller -> ThreadPool ** : execute

alt available thread
activate Controller #DarkSalmon
Controller --> Controller : waiting for response
ThreadPool -> Thread **: new/from pool
	Thread -> Service ++ #gold:
	Service -> Thread -- :.
	Thread --> Controller : CompletableFuture End
deactivate Controller
else queue is full
	ThreadPool -[#red]> Controller : error
end
deactivate Controller

== Same as above with other Service/s call/s ==

Controller --> Controller ++: build response
Controller -[#blue]> Client : ok

note right
After to analize each response you may
return ok/error or take some compensating action
end note
